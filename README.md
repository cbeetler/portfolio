# portfolio

Template portfolio website developed with instruction and guidelines from Learn HTML CSS. 
The first of two final projects for the course, this is a simple front-end website for a professional portfolio.
Lessons 123 through 127.

Currently in the process of refactoring the site to meet personal use.

## Usage

No plans to host this site as of now so you'll have to run it locally if you would like to view it.
I built this site outside of GitHub and prior to learning about Vite, so I am continuing to use Parcel 
as the bundler during refactoring purposes.

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the repo in cmd
3. `npm install parcel`
4. `npx parcel index.html`

This should get you there. If someone actually tries this out and it doesn't work let me know,
I may have missed a step while working from memory.
